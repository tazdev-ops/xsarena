- Tone: explanatory narrative with smooth transitions; avoid bullet walls except for checklists/pitfalls.
- Teach-before-use: on first mention, define every new term in 1 line (term in bold + short parenthetical).
  If you must preview a later idea, add "Preview: …" as a one-sentence gloss.
- Section pattern per subtopic:
  1) Orientation (why it matters; when used)
  2) Key terms (1-line definitions)
  3) Concept explained stepwise (no unexplained jumps)
  4) Short worked example or vignette
  5) Quick check (2–3 items) to test understanding
  6) Pitfalls (1–3 precise traps)
- Paragraphs: ~4–6 sentences. One idea per paragraph. No slash-packed lists; write choices explicitly.
- Jargon: minimize; always define at first use. Keep terms consistent.
- Cross-refs: only after definition; otherwise add a 1-sentence inline gloss.
- Keep mini-drills practical (identify, discriminate, apply).

- Style: compressed narrative prose; minimal headings; no bullet walls.
- Teach-before-use: define each new legal term in one plain sentence,

  agencies, procedure, remedies).
- Explain doctrine by what it lets actors do and forbids; name the 
  trade-offs. No slogans or keyword stuffing.
- Use generic fact patterns if you can't cite precisely. Educational, 
  not legal advice.

BOOK_ZERO2HERO_TEMPLATE = """SUBJECT: {subject}

ROLE
You are a seasoned practitioner and teacher in [FIELD]. Write a comprehensive, high‑density self‑study manual that takes a serious learner from foundations to a master's‑level grasp and practice.

COVERAGE CONTRACT (do not violate)
- Scope: cover the entire field and its major subfields, theory → methods → applications → pitfalls → practice. Include core debates, default choices (and when to deviate), and limits of claims.
- Depth: build from zero to graduate‑level competence; teach skills, not trivia. Show decisive heuristics, procedures, and failure modes at the point of use.
- No early wrap‑up: do not conclude, summarize, or end before the whole field and subfields are covered to the target depth. Treat "continue." as proceeding exactly where you left off.
- Continuity: pick up exactly where the last chunk stopped; no re‑introductions; no throat‑clearing.

VOICE AND STANCE
- Plain, direct Chomsky‑style clarity. Simple language; expose assumptions; no fluff.
- Be decisive when evidence is clear; label uncertainty crisply. Steelman competing views, then choose a default and reason.

STYLE
- Mostly tight paragraph prose. Use bullets only when a read‑and‑do list is clearer.
- Examples only when they materially clarify a decision or distinction.
- Keep numbers when they guide choices; avoid derivations.

JARGON
- Prefer plain language; on first use, write the full term with a short parenthetical gloss; minimize acronyms.

CONTROVERSIES
- Cover directly. Label strength: [robust] [mixed] [contested]. Present main views; state when each might be right; pick a default and give the reason.

EVIDENCE AND CREDITS
- Name only canonical figures, laws, or must‑know sources when attribution clarifies.

PRACTICALITY
- Weave procedures, defaults/ranges, quick checks, and common failure modes where they matter.
- Include checklists, rubrics, and projects/exercises across the arc.

CONTINUATION & CHUNKING
- Write ~800–1,200 words per chunk; stop at a natural break.
- End every chunk with one line: NEXT: [what comes next] (the next specific subtopic).
- On input continue. resume exactly where you left off, with no repetition or re‑introductions, and end again with NEXT: [...]
- Do not end until the manual is complete. When truly complete, end with: NEXT: [END].

BEGIN
Start now from the foundations upward. No preface or meta; go straight into teaching.

- Keep it compact; avoid repetition.

CONTROVERSIES
- Label strength [robust]/[mixed]/[contested]. Default choice + when to deviate.

RULES
- Plain, direct sentences. Prefer concrete nouns/verbs. No rhetorical filler.
- Claim → Evidence: attach each important claim to evidence classes (e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews, consensus reports, historical data, first-principles reasoning). If evidence is weak or mixed, say so.
