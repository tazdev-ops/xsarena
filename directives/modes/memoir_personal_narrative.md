# Memoir / Personal Narrative Mode

For personal stories, reflections.

Structure:
- Chronological or thematic
- Show, don't tell
- Vivid sensory details
- Dialogue when relevant
- Arc: situation → complication → resolution → reflection

Style:
- First-person
- Present-tense for immediacy
- Emotional honesty
- Specific details (not generalizations)
- Natural voice

Avoid explaining emotions you're showing.
