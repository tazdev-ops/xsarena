OVERLAY: steelman-first

OVERLAY: evidence-ladder
- Grade evidence: analytic/logical > replicated empirical > observational > testimonial/phenomenological > speculative/model.

OVERLAY: fallacy-scan
- Flag formal/informal fallacies (begging the question, equivocation, composition, etc.); explain why succinctly.

OVERLAY: underdetermination-guard
- Note when multiple hypotheses equally explain the data; avoid overstating inference.

OVERLAY: clarity-first
- Define terms and scope at the outset (e.g., "classical theism," "deism," "pantheism," "naturalism").
