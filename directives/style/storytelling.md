# Storytelling Overlay

Use narrative techniques:
- Open with hook (anecdote, question, scenario)
- Use concrete examples before abstractions
- Build tension: problem → exploration → resolution
- Scene-setting before diving in
- Callbacks to earlier examples
- End sections with cliffhangers/questions

Avoid:
- Dry fact recitation
- Abstract-first explanations
- Lists without context
