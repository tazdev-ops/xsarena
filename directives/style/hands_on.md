# Hands-On / Workshop Style

Emphasize doing over reading:
- Every concept gets immediate exercise
- "Try this now" moments
- Include expected output + common errors
- Progressive challenges (easy â†’ hard)

Format per section:
1. Brief concept (3-4 sentences)
2. Step-by-step exercise
3. What you should see
4. Common mistakes
5. Extension challenge
