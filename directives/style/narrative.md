PEDAGOGY & NARRATIVE OVERLAY
- Tone: explanatory narrative with smooth transitions; avoid bullet walls except for checklists/pitfalls.
- Teach-before-use: on first mention, define every new term in 1 line (term in bold + short parenthetical).
  If you must preview a later idea, add "Preview: …" as a one-sentence gloss.
- Section pattern per subtopic:
  1) Orientation (why it matters; when used)
  2) Key terms (1-line definitions)
  3) Concept explained stepwise (no unexplained jumps)
  4) Short worked example or vignette
  5) Quick check (2–3 items) to test understanding
  6) Pitfalls (1–3 precise traps)
- Paragraphs: ~4–6 sentences. One idea per paragraph. No slash-packed lists; write choices explicitly.
- Jargon: minimize; always define at first use. Keep terms consistent.
- Cross-refs: only after definition; otherwise add a 1-sentence inline gloss.
- Keep mini-drills practical (identify, discriminate, apply).
