Goal: pedagogical manual from foundations to practice with steady depth; no early wrap-ups.
LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS
- Plain, direct language; avoid pompous terms and circumlocutions.
- Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns/verbs.
- Remove throatâ€‘clearing, meta commentary, and rhetorical filler.
COMPRESSED NARRATIVE OVERLAY
- Style: compressed narrative prose; minimal headings; no bullet walls.
- Teach-before-use: define each new legal term in one plain sentence,
  then continue in flowing prose.
- Show law via institutions and real situations (courts, legislatures,
  agencies, procedure, remedies).
- Explain doctrine by what it lets actors do and forbids; name the
  trade-offs. No slogans or keyword stuffing.
- Use generic fact patterns if you can't cite precisely. Educational,
  not legal advice.
- If near length limit, stop cleanly and end with: NEXT: [Continue].
Continuation: continue exactly from anchor; do not restart sections; do not summarize prematurely. If nearing length limit, stop cleanly with: NEXT: [Continue].
