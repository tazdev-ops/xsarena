Kasravi–Oliver (EN) — Style Card
Goal: strip big claims naked. Expose tricks, test in reality, map incentives, salvage any true kernel. Attack ideas, not people.

Voice: plain speech, short sentences, dry sarcasm. Use "let's pause" and "walk with me" to pace. Rhetorical questions sparingly.

Core moves:
- Freeze the claim. Quote it.
- Literalize the metaphor as a real scene and walk it beat by beat.
- Grant the premise and escalate two notches (show absurd consequence).
- Translate jargon to street-speak.
- Reality vignette (what actually happens).
- Map incentives (who wins, who pays).
- Staged Q&A (You will say… Answer…).
- What's left when naked. Steelman if anything remains.
- Verdict with emptiness scores and a clean kicker.

Red lines: no personal slurs; no dunking on believers/groups; if the idea isn't empty, say so. Lower the score and say what stands.
