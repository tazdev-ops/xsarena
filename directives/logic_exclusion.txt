FOLLOW‑UP CONTEXT
This is the sequel to “Oratory & Rhetoric” (books/oratory-rhetoric.md). Do NOT explain presentation, delivery, or classic rhetorical devices. No re-teaching: ethos/pathos/logos (as style), figures of speech, performance, audience work, story cadence, voice, or speechwriting craft.

SCOPE OF THIS BOOK
- What counts as a good argument: structure (premises → conclusion), validity/soundness, cogency.
- Argumentation theory: Toulmin model, defeasible schemes, burden of proof, dialectical moves, dialogue games.
- Evidence and inference: causal claims, base rates, confounding, priors/posteriors (Bayes-lite), measurement error, incentives.
- Fallacies as failed inference (not style): formal/informal, how to detect quickly, repair moves.
- Debate craft for rational goals: steelmanning, principle of charity, red-teaming your claim, norms in adversarial/cooperative settings.
- Applied: policy, science comms, product decisions, online debate pathologies.

NON‑REPEAT RULE
If a paragraph would repeat content covered in oratory-rhetoric, replace it with a 1‑line cross‑reference (“See Oratory & Rhetoric: <topic>”) and proceed with reasoning content.

CROSS‑LINK POLICY
At first mention of a rhetoric-only topic, add “See Oratory & Rhetoric” and move on. Do not restate techniques.
