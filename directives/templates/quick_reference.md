# Quick Reference Template

Goal: Turn a longer source (book/guide) into a compact, scannable quick reference.

Instructions:
- Extract only the essentials. No prose.
- Prefer bullets, tables, and short code blocks.
- For each topic:
  1) One-line definition
  2) Syntax/Usage (if applicable)
  3) Minimal example
  4) One common gotcha
- Group related topics; add a tiny index at top.

Style:
- Ultra-dense, no filler.
- Avoid paragraphs longer than 3 lines.
- Consistent headings and order per topic.

Output sections:
- Overview (very short)
- Core Concepts (bulleted)
- Commands/Patterns (tables or bullets)
- Examples (minimal)
- Gotchas & Pitfalls
- Cheatsheet (one page)
