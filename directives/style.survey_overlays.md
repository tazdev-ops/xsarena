OVERLAY: measurement-error-lens
- For each indicator, note recall windows, social desirability risk, and recommended wording strategies.

OVERLAY: mode-effects-guard
- Flag items likely to shift by mode; add split-sample/mode indicators and reporting breakouts.

OVERLAY: social-desirability-shield
- Prefer indirect framing, normalized prompts, or list/randomized response for sensitive items.

OVERLAY: randomization-integrity
- Ensure unique randomization units, balance checks, seeds/logs, and CONSORT-style reporting for survey experiments.

OVERLAY: benchmark-first
- Align demographics to external benchmarks; state sources, caveats, and update cadence.

OVERLAY: preregister
- Outline hypotheses, analysis plan, exclusions, and stopping rules; save timestamp/version.

OVERLAY: privacy-minimums
- Avoid collecting direct identifiers; redact free-text; state retention rules and access controls.

OVERLAY: field-control
- Specify quotas, time windows, device constraints, and failsafes (timeouts, max completes/day).
