subject: Anchors & NEXT Smoke
system_text: "Goal: pedagogical manual from foundations to practice with steady depth;\
  \ no early wrap-ups.\nLANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS\n- Plain, direct language; avoid pompous\
  \ terms and circumlocutions.\n- Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns/verbs.\n\
  - Remove throatâ€‘clearing, meta commentary, and rhetorical filler.\nCOMPRESSED NARRATIVE\
  \ OVERLAY\n- Style: compressed narrative prose; minimal headings; no bullet walls.\n\
  - Teach-before-use: define each new legal term in one plain sentence,\n  then continue\
  \ in flowing prose.\n- Show law via institutions and real situations (courts, legislatures,\n\
  \  agencies, procedure, remedies).\n- Explain doctrine by what it lets actors do\
  \ and forbids; name the\n  trade-offs. No slogans or keyword stuffing.\n- Use generic\
  \ fact patterns if you can't cite precisely. Educational,\n  not legal advice.\n\
  - If near length limit, stop cleanly and end with: NEXT: [Continue].\nContinuation:\
  \ continue exactly from anchor; do not restart sections; do not summarize prematurely.\
  \ If nearing length limit, stop cleanly with: NEXT: [Continue]."
