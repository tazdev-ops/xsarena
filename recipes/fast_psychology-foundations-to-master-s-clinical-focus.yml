subject: Psychology — Foundations to Master's (Clinical Focus)
system_text: "Goal: pedagogical manual from foundations to practice with steady depth;\
  \ no early wrap-ups.\nLANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS\n- Plain, direct language; avoid pompous\
  \ terms and circumlocutions.\n- Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns/verbs.\n\
  - Remove throat‑clearing, meta commentary, and rhetorical filler.\nPEDAGOGY & NARRATIVE\
  \ OVERLAY\n- Tone: explanatory narrative with smooth transitions; avoid bullet walls\
  \ except for checklists/pitfalls.\n- Teach-before-use: on first mention, define\
  \ every new term in 1 line (term in bold + short parenthetical).\n  If you must\
  \ preview a later idea, add \"Preview: …\" as a one-sentence gloss.\n- Section pattern\
  \ per subtopic:\n  1) Orientation (why it matters; when used)\n  2) Key terms (1-line\
  \ definitions)\n  3) Concept explained stepwise (no unexplained jumps)\n  4) Short\
  \ worked example or vignette\n  5) Quick check (2–3 items) to test understanding\n\
  \  6) Pitfalls (1–3 precise traps)\n- Paragraphs: ~4–6 sentences. One idea per paragraph.\
  \ No slash-packed lists; write choices explicitly.\n- Jargon: minimize; always define\
  \ at first use. Keep terms consistent.\n- Cross-refs: only after definition; otherwise\
  \ add a 1-sentence inline gloss.\n- Keep mini-drills practical (identify, discriminate,\
  \ apply).\nContinuation: continue exactly from anchor; do not restart sections;\
  \ do not summarize prematurely. If nearing length limit, stop cleanly with: NEXT:\
  \ [Continue]."
