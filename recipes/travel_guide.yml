  Create an insider's travel guide:

  Structure:
  1. Getting there & around (practical logistics)
  2. Neighborhoods guide (character of each area)
  3. Top experiences (not just sights - experiences)
  4. Food & drink (where locals go)
  5. Hidden gems (off-beaten-path)
  6. Day trips & itineraries (3/5/7 day plans)
  7. Practical tips (money, safety, customs)
  8. Seasonal considerations
  9. Budget breakdowns (budget/mid/luxury)

  Style:
  - First-person observations
  - Vivid descriptions (sights, sounds, smells)
  - Honest pros/cons
  - Specific recommendations (not generic)
  - Current as of [DATE]
  - Include local phrases

  Avoid:
  - Generic "must-see" lists
  - Outdated information
  - Hotel/restaurant shilling
