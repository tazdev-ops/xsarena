  Goal: no‑bullshit manual; only what changes decisions or understanding; tight prose.
  LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS
  - Plain, direct language; avoid pompous terms and circumlocutions.
  - Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns/verbs.
  - Remove throat‑clearing, meta commentary, and rhetorical filler.
  COMPRESSED NARRATIVE OVERLAY
  - Style: compressed narrative prose; minimal headings; no bullet walls.
  - Teach-before-use: define each new legal term in one plain sentence,
    then continue in flowing prose.
  - Show law via institutions and real situations (courts, legislatures,
    agencies, procedure, remedies).
  - Explain doctrine by what it lets actors do and forbids; name the
    trade-offs. No slogans or keyword stuffing.
  - Use generic fact patterns if you can't cite precisely. Educational,
    not legal advice.
  - If near length limit, stop cleanly and end with: NEXT: [Continue].
  Continuation: continue exactly from anchor; do not restart sections; do not summarize prematurely. If nearing length limit, stop cleanly with: NEXT: [Continue].
