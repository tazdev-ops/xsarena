# XSArena

XSArena is a human writer workflow tool that bridges to LMArena for long-form content creation. It focuses on providing a structured approach to writing books, manuals, and other long-form content with AI assistance.

## Quick Start

- **Install**: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- **Start bridge**: `xsarena ops service start-bridge-v2`
- **First run**: `xsarena run book "Hello World" --length standard --span medium`

## Essential Workflows

### Book Authoring
Generate comprehensive books from zero to hero level with structured prompts:
```bash
# Create a book with default settings
xsarena run book "Machine Learning Fundamentals"

# Create a longer book with custom length and span
xsarena run book "Advanced Python Programming" --length long --span book

# Plan first, then write
xsarena run from-plan --subject "History of Rome"
```

### Interactive Mode
Start an interactive session for real-time collaboration:
```bash
xsarena interactive start
```

### Study Aids
Generate educational materials from your content:
```bash
# Create flashcards from a text file
xsarena study generate flashcards path/to/content.txt

# Generate a quiz
xsarena study generate quiz path/to/content.txt --num 20

# Create a glossary
xsarena study generate glossary path/to/content.txt
```

### Content Processing
Process and refine content with lossless operations:
```bash
# Rewrite text while preserving meaning
xsarena author lossless-rewrite "Your text here..."

# Improve flow and transitions
xsarena author lossless-improve-flow "Your text here..."

# Enhance structure with headings
xsarena author lossless-enhance-structure "Your text here..."
```
