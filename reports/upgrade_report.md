# XSArena Grand Unification & Feature Integration Report

## Summary

This report documents the comprehensive refactoring and feature integration process for XSArena. All planned features and architectural improvements have been successfully implemented, transforming the project into a professional, feature-complete, and highly robust application.

## Completed Tasks

### PHASE A: Foundation & Architectural Cleanup
1. **Full Architectural Migration**: Completed migration to `.xsarena` directory structure, cleaned up legacy artifacts, and standardized naming conventions.
2. **Finalize CLI Structure**: Implemented semantic command groups (`author`, `analyze`, `study`, `dev`, `ops`, `project`, `directives`) with centralized registration in `registry.py`.
3. **Unify State Management**: Established `SessionState` as single source of truth, added `settings persist` and `settings reset` commands, and enforced proper configuration loading order.

### PHASE B: Core Feature Integration
4. **--follow Flag**: Implemented `--follow` flag for `run book` and `run continue` commands to enable job submission and monitoring in a single command.
5. **Chapter and Checklist Tools**: Implemented `tools export-chapters` and `tools extract-checklists` commands for post-processing generated content.
6. **Security and Endpoint Discovery**: Implemented `analyze secrets` command and `run endpoints list/show` commands for security scanning and endpoint management.

### PHASE C: Advanced Systems
7. **Run Manifests & Replay**: Implemented run manifest generation with system_text, resolved RunSpec, directive digests, and config snapshot. Added `run replay` command with directive drift detection.
8. **Job Scheduler Enhancement**: Enhanced job scheduler with priority support (0-10 scale) and implemented `jobs boost` command. Added systemd service installation for bridge server.
9. **Bridge Fortification**: Enhanced bridge server with Cloudflare auto-retry mechanism that sends refresh command to userscript and retries once before failing. Added offline simulation with `dev simulate` command.

### PHASE D: Final Polish
10. **Minimal Web Console**: Implemented read-only web console at `/console` endpoint with API endpoints (`/api/jobs`, `/api/jobs/{job_id}`) and live-updating job table and event log.
11. **Documentation Overhaul**: Created comprehensive documentation including getting started, architecture, configuration, commands, and workflows guides.

## Outstanding Issues
