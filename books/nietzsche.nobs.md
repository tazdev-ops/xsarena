Primitives

- Drive: a push from within. No stable “self,” only a shifting hierarchy of drives.

- Will to power: the tendency of drives to expand, organize, and interpret in their favor. Not “domination” only; includes mastery of self, creation, integration.

- Type: a stable pattern of drive-order. “Strong” types command themselves; “decadent” types are ruled by reactive drives.

- Value: a ranking of things as good/bad that serves a type’s needs.

- Morality: a value-system that universalizes one type’s needs as binding on all.

- Perspectivism: all knowing is from a standpoint; no view from nowhere. Better perspectives integrate more forces and contradictions.

- Genealogy: explain a value by its origin, function, and beneficiaries.

- Ressentiment: long-breeding vengeful reactivity that cannot discharge outward, so it inverts value and poisons inward.

- Ascetic ideal: a strategy to give meaning to suffering by blaming the self and sanctifying self-denial.

- Nihilism: collapse of old highest values and the meanings they carried.

- Revaluation: deliberate remaking of value-rankings in favor of stronger life.

- Health/decadence: health is an abundance of organizing power; decadence is disaggregation, fatigue, anesthesia.

- Eternal recurrence: a test of affirmation—would you will your life again, exactly, forever?

- Amor fati: love of your fate, all of it; no resentment against necessity.

- Overman: a higher type who creates values, lives beyond herd morality, integrates cruelty and creativity.

Mechanisms

Drive order. Your “soul” is governance: some drives command, others obey. Strong types synthesize tensions into a style. Weak types suppress, split, or numb.

Interpretation. Every drive interprets the world to favor its expansion. “Truths” are stabilized victories of certain drives. Knowledge is a tool of life, not a mirror.

Valuation and function. A value is a tool. Ask: what work does it do? For whom? A value that reduces fear may also reduce strength. A value that increases discipline may also increase cruelty; the question is toward what.

Reactive and active forces. Active forces discharge outward: create, risk, transform. Reactive forces negate: they limit, forbid, calculate. Civilization needs both; decadence is when reactivity rules and cannot turn active.

Internalization. When external discharge is blocked, force turns inward. Result: memory, conscience, depth. Also: guilt, self-torture. Culture rises from sublimated cruelty. Excess internalization breeds sickness.

Priestly strategy. The “priest” type lacks direct force but commands by meanings. He brands power as “evil,” weakness as “good.” He cures pain by giving it a moral cause and a debtor: you.

Slave morality. Inversion mechanism:
- Redefine “good” as harmless, equal, humble.
- Redefine “evil” as noble traits: pride, strength, rank.
- Universalize this code as morality for all.
- Center intention over consequence to punish motive.
- Invent free will to justify blame and guilt.

Ascetic ideal’s function. It answers “why suffer?” with “because you are guilty.” It gives purpose to pain and control to the priest. It preserves the sick by keeping them manageable.

Death of God. Collapse of the highest unifying fiction. Without that center, meanings drift. Two paths:
- Weak nihilism: anesthetic values (comfort, pity, equality as ends) that flatten.
- Strong nihilism: clearing the ground for new creation.

Truth and error. “Truth” is a mobile army of metaphors that forgot they are made. Some errors support life (e.g., belief in stable selves); some truths destroy it (e.g., reductive mechanistic despair). Criterion: what increases organizing power without self-deception you cannot own.

Rank and distance. Culture requires orders of rank and “pathos of distance.” Not all tasks or virtues fit all types. Forcing one measure harms excellence and honesty.

Art. Art is the stimulant to life. It justifies existence aesthetically when metaphysics fails. Tragedy teaches saying yes to pain.

Decisions

How to assess a value or practice:
- Genealogize it: trace origin, type, function.
- Identify beneficiaries: which drives or types gain?
- Check effects: does it increase integration, energy, fecundity? Or numb, flatten, embitter?
- Detect resentment: is its “good” defined by negation of others?
- Test affirmation: can you will its consequences recurring?
- Keep, transform, or discard.

How to use suffering:
- Don’t moralize it; instrument it.
- Bind it to growth tasks: training, creation, exacting honesty.
- Avoid pity that robs meaning; prefer help that strengthens responsibility.

Self-cultivation:
- Choose enemies worthy of you; they shape you.
- Select constraints that bite; they give form.
- Practice severity with yourself; generosity with risk.
- Refuse purity; integrate your drives under a commanding style.
- Say yes to necessity; harvest it.

Defaults

- Default criterion: life-affirmation defined as expansion, integration, capacity to promise, to risk, to create. Not hedonism; not mere survival.

- Default suspicion: values preaching equality, pity, guilt as highest goods often mask reactive needs. Test them case by case.

- Default stance toward truth: prefer perspectives that empower creation and honesty about costs. Avoid consolations you cannot avow publicly to yourself.

Controversies

- Will to power: metaphysics or psychology?
  - Positions: ontology of all being [contested]; drive-psychology heuristic [mixed].
  - Default: heuristic of interpretation; robust across texts; avoids weak cosmology.

- Perspectivism: self-refuting?
  - Positions: collapses into relativism [contested]; calibrated pluralism with ranks of perspectives [robust].
  - Default: ranked perspectivism; better views integrate more and falsify less for action.

- Eternal recurrence: literal physics or ethical test?
  - Positions: cosmology [contested]; existential filter [mixed].
  - Default: test of affirmation; it sorts types, focuses choices.

- Overman: political program or individual ideal?
  - Positions: eugenic/political blueprint [contested]; figure of self-overcoming [mixed].
  - Default: ideal type for personal rank-building; no policy.

- Politics: proto-fascist or culture critic?
  - Positions: authoritarian elitist [contested]; anti-statist aristocrat of spirit [mixed].
  - Default: culture-first, suspicious of mass politics; ranking in culture, not party platforms.

- Women/Jews/others: bigoted or diagnostic?
  - Positions: misogynist and prejudiced [robust for many passages]; strategically provocative diagnostician [mixed].
  - Default: acknowledge prejudice; extract mechanisms where independent; don’t excuse.

- Pity and compassion:
  - Positions: rejects compassion [contested]; targets pity as weakening when institutionalized [mixed].
  - Default: reject pity that preserves weakness; accept aid that increases strength and responsibility.

Constraints

- Not for everyone. These tools are dangerous. They can excuse cruelty if you cheat on honesty.

- Self-deception is the central enemy. To affirm fate, you must see it.

- Some illusions are necessary. Choose them consciously; own their function.

- Creation demands exclusion. Saying yes to your path means saying no to many goods.

Applied example (sketch)

Take “equality”:
- Origin/function: Christian-legal leveling; protects weak from strong.
- Beneficiaries: reactive types, modern states.
- Effects: justice gains; rank-confusion; mediocrity protected.
- Affirmation test: keep as legal equality for mutual restraint; reject as highest moral value when it flattens excellence.
- Action: defend equal protection; fight spiritual leveling in culture.

What follows

- We will build the genealogical toolkit: step-by-step analysis of guilt, bad conscience, and the ascetic ideal; then apply it to modern morals (pity, work, science, democracy).

- We will craft affirmative practices: recurrence as decision rule; choosing enemies; style; training severity; cultivating gratitude.

Genealogical method (operational)

- Name the value/practice.
- Track words: earlier meanings, metaphors, legal roots.
- Map power: which types/drives benefit; which lose.
- Chart affects: what emotions it breeds, suppresses, redirects.
- Find blockage: where discharge outward was prevented.
- Follow internalization: what new faculties formed (memory, conscience).
- Identify priestly reinterpretation: how blame, guilt, “free will” were installed.
- Note modern conversions: state, market, science remixes.
- Health test: integration up or down? energy up or down?
- Decision: keep (as-is), transform (redirect), discard (where possible).

Guilt

- Definition: internalized creditor–debtor relation.
- Origin: “Schuld” = debt. Punishment was creditor’s right to enjoy pain as compensation. Pain forged memory: “I will remember to repay.”
- Function (early): breed promise-keeping through fear and pain. Construct the “sovereign individual” who can promise because he can command himself.
- Priest move: recode debt as sin against God; expand jurisdiction to thoughts and motives; invent “free will” to justify infinite blame; make suffering meaningful via guilt.
- Modern remix: secular guilt persists (ideological purity, carbon guilt, productivity guilt). Media amplifies surveillance; mobs act as priests.
- Health test: Does guilt increase capacity to promise and create? Or does it paralyze, ruminate, and seek penance loops?
- Action:
  - Keep: responsibility for promises; restitution to concrete creditors; learning from pain.
  - Transform: swap “sin” for error and cost; pay, repair, change practice.
  - Discard: metaphysical guilt, totalizing shame, motive-policing beyond action.

Bad conscience

- Definition: self-cruelty when drives are caged and turned inward.
- Origin: taming of humans in states; instincts blocked; force rebounds into the “soul.”
- Function: produces depth, memory, conscience; also self-laceration.
- Priest move: aim the accumulated aggression at the self; eternalize debt; sanctify self-punishment.
- Symptoms: rumination, self-suspicion, allergy to joy, moral exhibitionism.
- Health test: Does inward severity fund creation and reliability? Or does it waste energy on self-hate?
- Action:
  - Keep: inwardness as workshop; exacting standards aimed at a work.
  - Transform: redirect aggression into training, art, truth-telling.
  - Discard: sterile self-accusation, confession theater, purity spirals.

Ascetic ideal

- Definition: meaning of suffering via self-blame and denial.
- Function: gives purpose to pain; prevents despair and chaos; gives priests power; preserves the sick by organizing them.
- For the strong: sometimes a tool for self-mastery (athlete, artist) when chosen and aimed.
- Science variant: inherits will to truth; self-denial, rigor, anti-illusion. Exposes idols, including its own, leading toward nihilism if “truth” is highest and life be damned.
- Health test: Does denial serve a larger yes? Or is it negation for its own sake?
- Action:
  - Keep: discipline in service of creation and honesty.
  - Transform: from “no to life” to “no to noise” so a stronger yes can be built.
  - Discard: sanctified weakness, universal prescriptions of abstinence, life-hatred masked as virtue.

  - No call-outs; do call-ins privately; reserve public charges for crimes and institutions.
  - Archive your posts; delete heat; keep proofs.

Aphorism drill

- Source mind under pressure.
- Protocol:
  - Daily: write ten lines under 140 characters; no abstractions without example.
  - Cut until one sting remains.
  - Read aloud; test for rhythm and edge.
  - Publish one per week; burn the rest or reuse as seeds.
- Rules: no sarcasm; no slogans; no borrowed thunder.

Recurrence micro-loops

- Identify three daily loops: email, chat, snack.
- Ask: would I will this loop exactly forever?
- Redesign two:
  - Email: two windows; templates; auto-rules.
  - Chat: mute default; office hours; move to async.
  - Snack: replace with water walk; schedule meals.
- Review in seven days; keep only loops you can affirm.

Family strategy

- Premise: love binds; also claims. Integrate without lying.
- Actions:
  - Define non-negotiables (work blocks, law of the house); state calmly; enforce.
  - Give clear gifts: time, money, labor. No hidden resentment.
  - Exit stale roles: child, savior, clown. Replace with adult terms.
  - Ritualize visits; end on time; send letters between.
- Guardrail: don’t recruit family to your guild; keep domains distinct.

Travel as training

- Purpose: sharpen senses, break routines, test style in alien frames.
- Actions:
  - Travel light; one bag; one book; one aim.
  - Walk cities; skip tourist checklists; visit cemeteries and markets.
  - Speak the language badly; accept humiliation as tuition.
  - Bring one object home; assign a function; avoid souvenir clutter.
- Post: write a one-page report; list one change kept after return.

Substances

- Function: modulate state; risk of ownership reversal.
- Defaults:
  - Caffeine: tool; cycle to prevent tolerance; no after noon.
  - Alcohol: rare; never at cost of dawns; social amplitude only.
  - Nicotine: high risk of ownership; avoid unless deliberate micro-dose for work sprints with strict bounds.
  - Psychedelics: ritual, rare, guided; integrate by work; never as bypass.
- Rule: if a substance steals command, it’s out.

Judgment craft

- Aim: clean, fast, fair verdicts aligned to your law.
- Steps:
  - Define jurisdiction: what is yours to judge?
  - Gather only disconfirming evidence first.
  - Draft the harshest read; then subtract resentment.
  - Decide; set cost; declare; move on.
- Appeals: allowed with new facts and self-cost by the appellant.

Praise economy

- Use praise as currency to grow what you value.
- Rules:
  - Precise, scarce, tied to action and form.
  - No praise for identity; praise for risks taken, craft, honesty.
  - Public praise for juniors; private for peers; upward only when earned.

Iconoclasm and idolatry

- Hammer test:
  - Identify idols in your house: metrics, mentors, methods.
  - Strike with a sharp critique; if it shatters, replace; if it rings, keep.
- Don’t destroy what you can’t replace; build substitutes first.

Edge and kindness

- Pair sharpness with warmth to avoid needless enemies.
- Actions:
  - Open with steel; end with bread.
  - Separate person from act in your speech.
  - Offer one path to redemption with cost.

Metrics that matter

- Core:
  - Promises kept / made ratio.
  - Works shipped per quarter.
  - Recovery time after failure.
  - Number and quality of worthy enemies.
  - Energy balance weekly.
- Remove vanity metrics: followers, impressions, titles without teeth.

When to quit

- Signals:
  - Chronic resentment toward a path you chose.
  - No growth in a year despite honest effort and feedback.
  - Law conflicts you will not accept.
- Protocol:
  - Declare to your circle; set exit date.
  - Pay debts; document lessons; burn bridges only when your law demands.
  - Enter an apprenticeship or a sabbatical with form.

Outer and inner law conflict

- If public law violates your house law:
  - Options: comply and compartmentalize; resist and pay; exit jurisdiction.
- Default: avoid martyrdom; choose domains with air for your law; build parallel orders.

Endgame view

- You die. Your style remains or not.
- Aim for forms that teach beyond you: works, rites, a guild, a doctrine that bites.
- Accept being misunderstood; protect your seed; time will judge.

Objections and counters

- “Will to power = domination.” [contested]
  - Counter: includes self-mastery, integration, creation. Domination is one mode, often reactive. Test by outputs: does power enlarge form and others’ powers? If not, it’s small.

- “Perspectivism = relativism.” [contested]
  - Counter: ranks exist. Better perspectives integrate more forces and predict costs. Use action-success and integration as rank criteria.

- “Ascetic ideal is bad.” [mixed]
  - Counter: bad when it sanctifies weakness. Useful when it serves a stronger yes (training, focus). Keep as tool; reject as highest.

- “Equality is evil.” [contested]
  - Counter: legal equality restrains predation; keep. Spiritual leveling kills rank; fight. Split domains.

- “He rejects compassion.” [mixed]
  - Counter: he targets pity as weakening when institutionalized. Choose aid that increases capacity. Refuse enshrinement of hurt.

- “Hedonism.” [robustly false]
  - Counter: criterion is power and integration, not pleasure sums. Many pleasures weaken. Many pains strengthen.

- “Elitism means cruelty to the weak.” [contested]
  - Counter: cruelty is for form and promise-keeping, not humiliation. Protect rule of law; build cultural ranks by consent and proof.

- “Eternal recurrence is silly physics.” [contested]
  - Counter: treat as ethical filter. It sorts choices and types. Use it; ignore cosmology debates unless you need them.

- “Science refutes him.” [contested]
  - Counter: he treats science as tool. Rejects scientism as metaphysics. Pair truth with life-criteria.

- “He’s inconsistent.” [mixed]
  - Counter: masks change with aims. Diagnose the type in each mask; test across works. Keep what works; discard idiosyncrasies you cannot use.

Decision trees

Speak or stay silent?
- Is there a clear jurisdiction? If no, stay silent.
- Will speaking create a form or only heat? If heat, stay silent.
- Can you sign it forever? If no, wait.
- If yes: speak briefly, tie to cost, publish once.

Fight or exit?
- Is the battleground your main power? If no, exit.
- Will winning strengthen your law? If no, exit.
- Is there a fair frame to fight? If no, set it; if rejected, exit.
- If yes: write rules; fight fast; log lessons.

Keep or quit?
- Does it pass recurrence? If no, fix; if unfixable, quit.
- Are debts payable within a season? If no, negotiate exit; pay with cost.
- Has growth stalled for a year with honest effort? If yes, quit.

Help or withhold?
- Will help raise agency? If yes, help with constraints.
- Is help demanded as right? If yes, withhold or set hard terms.
- Are you buying innocence? If yes, stop.

Innovate or preserve?
- Is decay visible? If yes, innovate with a prototype.
- Is the form still teaching? If yes, preserve and teach.
- Can you carry both? If not, choose one by your main aim.

Field tests

- Public piece with risk (7 days).
- One difficult refusal tied to law (48 hours).
- One restitution to a creditor you wronged (this week).
- One purge of idols (today).
- One letter to a rival with respect and a clear challenge (this month).

Closing cautions

- Don’t aestheticize failure. Beautify form, not excuses.
- Don’t outsource your law to a guru or brand.
- Don’t confuse privacy with cowardice; or candor with virtue.
- Don’t collect ideas; cash them as works.

Signal to self

- When tired: reduce horizon to breath, walk, one kept promise.
- When swollen: give credit, increase standards, add a constraint.
- When afraid: dose risk one rung up; ask recurrence; step.

If asked for your doctrine, point to your house, your work, your circle, your enemies, your dead. If asked for your hope, say: more style.

Active forgetting

- Definition: shutting the account on a wound after costs are paid; not denial.
- Mechanism: strip affect from memory; keep fact for doctrine.
- Actions:
  - Write the ledger: harm, your part, restitution.
  - Pay or negotiate; set a close date.
  - Perform a closing rite (burn page, return object); no re-litigation.
- Test: if you still rehearse speeches in your head, it isn’t closed; repeat costs or cut the tie.

Selective remembering

- Build a canon of yes: ten scenes where you acted at your best.
- Rehearse them before hard moves; tune posture and breath to match.
- Archive proofs of competence; open when doubt spikes.
- Guard against nostalgia: use past only to strengthen next action.

Drive contracts

- Identify five dominant drives (curiosity, mastery, comfort, play, sex, dominance, care).
- For each:
  - Rights: times and contexts it leads.
  - Duties: what it serves (work, health, relation).
  - Limits: red lines; penalties for breach.
- Quarterly renegotiation; no drive gets permanent sovereignty.

Mask ledger

- List your arenas (workplace, home, guild, public).
- For each:
  - Mask name; function; risks; tell that exposes you; tell that protects you.
  - Signal for removal (who earns the inner voice).
- Rule: mask serves style; retire any that owns you.

Enemy correspondence

- Maintain a draft letter to your main rival:
  - Respect first: what they do better.
  - Challenge: the form you propose to test the difference.
  - Terms: judge, stakes, date.
- Send twice a year; accept silence as answer; fight ideas regardless.

Daily yes rite

- Morning: recite your law; one sentence.
- Choose your “one necessity” for the day; tie other tasks to it.
- Noon: affirm one constraint; drop one vanity task.
- Night: name one thing you’d will to recur; one you won’t; redesign the latter.

Misunderstanding protocol

- Don’t clarify to mobs; clarify to judges.
- Rule of three: if misread thrice by good-faith readers, adjust form.
- Archive slander; answer once if jurisdiction; otherwise, ship new work.
- Convert heat into doctrine: write a maxim that would have prevented it.

Exile plan

- Triggers: law conflict, chronic stagnation, priestly capture.
- Map exits: city, craft, institution, platform.
- Pack: minimal kit (tools, canon, contacts, cash runway).
- First 30 days: body regimen, silence, shipping cadence, one new circle.
- Avoid: grievance tours; burn only necessary bridges.

Patronage economy

- Choose patrons by taste and interference risk.
- Terms:
  - Clear scope; deliverables; review cadence.
  - No moral leverage; no content veto.
  - Option to refund to end relation.
- Diversify: no patron >20% support.
- Give patrons honors, not access to your law.

Names and pseudonyms

- Use a mask-name to experiment in public without diluting your main style.
- Keep a private ledger connecting names; plan for fusion or burial.
- Criteria to merge: when the experimental form proves itself under your law.
- Never slander across masks; do not farm outrage with one to feed another.

Dreams and omens

- Log dreams upon waking; tag by affects (fear, lust, shame, joy).
- Interpret as drives staging plays; ask what they want, what they warn.
- Extract one act per week from dreams (call, design, cut, confess).
- Superstition guard: no destiny claims; all omens must cash as work.

Physiology as dashboard

- Morning pulse, sleep, libido, appetite, urge to walk—track.
- If three are low for a week, scale demands; fix base (food, sun, sleep).
- No metaphysical conclusions when the body is down; postpone judgments.
- Use peaks for hard fights and binding oaths.

Jurisprudence of your law

- Statutes of limitations: define how long guilt can claim payment; keep short.
- Amnesty: calendar one day a year to forgive unpaid small debts, including your own, to free power.
- Proportionality: fit penalty to breach; no death sentence for lateness.
- Appeals: allowed with new work or cost; not with excuses.

Case sketches (applied)

- University (humanities):
  - Forces: priestly moral administration; publish-or-perish; status games masked as justice.
  - Strategy: serve students and craft; avoid committee theater; publish sharp work in modest venues; build a parallel guild; refuse purity rituals; leave if your law is gagged.
- Corporation (mid-level manager):
  - Forces: KPI idolatry; risk-aversion; HR priesthood.
  - Strategy: measure by shipped value; shield your team; teach severity without cruelty; speak exoterically upward; build exoteric wins that buy esoteric autonomy; exit when metrics force self-betrayal.
- Startup founder:
  - Forces: capital cycles; narrative addiction; martyrdom cult.

  - Forces: bureaucracy; liability fear; compassion fatigue.
  - Strategy: ritualize recovery; keep one research or craft thread; practice precise kindness; fight admin wars only when it increases patient care; build a peer circle outside the institution.

Border with other schools

- Stoicism: discipline, fate-love, role ethics. Use their exercises for steadiness; reject suppression disguised as virtue when it dulls creation. [mixed]
- Buddhism: non-attachment, compassion, insight into craving. Use to defuse ressentiment; guard against world-denial when it empties values. [mixed]
- Psychoanalysis/CBT: map drives, reframe thoughts. Use for tools; refuse identity by diagnosis. [robust as tools, not worldviews]

- Never use irony to protect cowardice; only to cut through priestly fog.

Proof over posture

- Rule: one shipped form beats ten opinions.
- Keep a public ledger of works; link claims to artifacts.
- Invite audits by peers you fear; pay up when they’re right.

End-note to self

- Actions:
  - Copy a page by hand; then rewrite in your style; compare cuts.
  - Extract a structure (opening, turn, close); reuse on new content.
  - Credit your sources when it costs you nothing; hide only when censors stalk.
  - Repay by surpassing: add clarity, force, or proof the original lacked.

Selecting teachers

  - They ship forms; they keep promises; they scare you a little.
  - Their cruelty grows students, not dependence.
- Protocol:
  - Submit to one teacher in one domain for a season.

- Depth day (monthly):
  - Library or studio isolation; one problem; no comms; exit with a draft or a design.

- Enemy test: would a worthy rival grant the premise? If not, strengthen it or drop.
- Recurrence test: would you will this judgment to recur? If not, you seek heat or innocence.
- Cost test: what are you willing to pay for this claim? If nothing, it’s posturing.

  - Accept penalties you owe; refuse humiliation rituals.

Unknowns and fog

- When unclear:
  - Reduce horizon to one kept promise; one walk; one refusal.
  - Ask a superior for a frame; obey once; learn.
  - Set a timer for doubt; when it ends, act and learn by result.

AI and tools (specific)

- Treat models as power tools; you remain the carpenter.
- Use for:
  - Drafting variants; compression; error-spotting; idea lists.
- Don’ts:
  - No outsourcing taste or final judgment.
  - No dependence for first thoughts; think before prompting.
- Rule: if a tool reduces time-to-shipped-form without dulling edge, keep; else, drop.

Public risk ladder (writing)

  - Essay (1,000–1,500): one claim, three proofs, one refusal; ship in 7 days.
  - Talk (10–15 min): one story, one doctrine, one test; deliver in 30 days.
  - Booklet (15–25k): a method; 90 days; public deadline.
- Debts: each rung missed costs a penalty you feel; predefine.

Court of taste

- Assemble three judges: one harsher than you; one different field; one junior.
- Give them your work with scoring rubrics (clarity, force, economy, style).
- Accept edits that increase bite or reduce noise; dispute only with proofs.
- Pay judges with work, not flattery.

Craft triangulation

- Choose a second craft (music, drawing, code) to cross-train your style.
