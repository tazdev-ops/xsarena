1) Drives and will to power
- Will to power: basic drive to expand strength, order, and influence.
- Mechanism: every thought and value expresses a drive; drives struggle for rank.
- Decisions: ask of each motive, “which drive wants this?” Rank drives. Feed active drives; starve reactive ones.
- Controversy: metaphysical principle vs psychological heuristic. Default: treat it as a physiological-psychological heuristic for analyzing motives. [mixed]

2) Perspectivism and truth
- Perspectivism: no “view from nowhere”; every claim comes from a standpoint.
- Truth: useful fictions that stabilize action; some fictions are life-advancing, others life-thinning.
- Decisions: test beliefs by their effects on strength, clarity, creativity. Keep multiple lenses; switch deliberately.
- Controversy: anything-goes relativism vs disciplined pluralism. Default: disciplined pluralism that compares perspectives by life-value. [robust]

3) Types: active vs reactive
- Active type: creates measure, imposes form, forgets productively.
- Reactive type: negates others, calculates, remembers injuries.
- Decisions: choose tasks where you shape rather than check. Identify resentment loops; break them with action.
- Diagnostics: energy after acting (active) vs fatigue and rumination (reactive).

4) Genealogy of morals
- Genealogy: historical-psychological method to uncover value origins and functions.
- Structure: noble morality (self-affirming) vs slave morality (other-condemning via ressentiment).
- Decisions: for any norm, ask: who benefits, who weakens, what instincts it cultivates or castrates.
- Controversy: literal history vs diagnostic parable. Default: use as diagnostic tool; don’t lean on archival proof. [mixed]

5) Ressentiment, bad conscience, guilt
- Ressentiment: long, covert hatred of the strong by the blocked.
- Bad conscience: instinct turned inward when action is impeded.
- Guilt: moralization of bad conscience; debt to a higher power.
- Decisions: discharge energy in deed, not verdict. Convert inward attack to training. Avoid moral revenge dressed as justice.

6) Nihilism and the death of God
- Death of God: collapse of transcendent guarantees for meaning and truth.
- Nihilism: highest values devalue themselves; life loses binding “why.”
- Types: passive (resignation, comfort anesthetics) vs active (clearing ground for new creation).
- Decisions: refuse substitutes (nation, science, morality) as new idols. Use the vacuum to set tasks.
- Controversy: pure diagnosis vs hidden prescription. Default: diagnosis that assigns a creative task. [robust]

7) Value creation and self-overcoming
- Value creation: legislating aims and measures instead of inheriting them.
- Self-overcoming: one drive reorganizes another into higher order.
- Übermensch: figure of self-legislation and full affirmation; not a biological type.
- Decisions: write your code; test it by whether it increases range and depth. Iterate; cut what weakens.
- Controversy: elitist caste vs existential exemplar. Default: exemplar of practices, not bloodline. [mixed]

8) Eternal recurrence
- Eternal recurrence: imagine living this life again, identically, forever.
- Function: pressure test for affirmation; intensifies responsibility.
- Decisions: run it on choices; if you would not will repetition, change the choice or yourself.
- Controversy: cosmology claim vs ethical experiment. Default: ethical experiment; ignore physics. [robust]

9) Ascetic ideal
- Ascetic ideal: meaning through self-denial; gives pain a purpose.
- Use: can train discipline; can also weaponize weakness via priestly control.
- Decisions: employ discipline to build capacity, not to despise life. Avoid moralizing your abstentions over others.
- Controversy: asceticism as sickness vs training. Default: training when it serves higher creation; sickness when it serves domination/escape. [mixed]

10) Suffering and amor fati
- Suffering: cost of growth; raw material for depth.
- Amor fati: love your fate—embrace necessity as your style.
- Decisions: pick aims worthy of pain. Translate setbacks into skills. Drop “if only”; ask “what can I make of this?”

11) Art, style, and noble falsification
- Art: highest counterforce to nihilism; makes becoming bearable.
- Style: expression of type; masks reveal essence by selection.
- Decisions: create more than critique. Curate your influences. Permit enabling fictions that raise your line.
- Controversy: truth first vs life first. Default: life first; truth as one tool among others. [contested]

12) Science, reason, critique
- Science: disciplined will to power; inherits ascetic drive to truth.
- Limit: describes and predicts; cannot justify why to live or what to value.
- Decisions: use science as instrument; don’t ask it for meaning. Keep creator above critic.
- Controversy: neutrality vs value-ladenness. Default: value-laden; it expresses a type’s priorities. [mixed]

13) Morality types: master vs slave
- Master morality: good = noble, capable, proud; bad = base, common.
- Slave morality: good = humble, harmless; evil = powerful oppressor.
- Decisions: detect which code governs your inner court. If creating, prefer master virtues inwardly; keep public peace prudently.
- Controversy: endorsement vs diagnosis. Default: endorse master traits for creators while acknowledging social need for some slave-moral constraints. [mixed]

14) Culture, politics, rank
- Herd: seeks safety, equality, comfort; levels difference.
- Higher culture: needs rank, distance, hard schooling.
- State: “cold monster”; easily captures values.
- Decisions: choose your circle; guard solitude; accept unpopularity. Build environments that protect long tasks.
- Controversy: anti-egalitarian charge. Default: cultivate excellence without cruelty; refuse envy politics. [contested]

15) Training and hygiene
- Body first: strength, sleep, sun, movement; mind follows physiology.
- Diet of inputs: great books, hard problems, silence; avoid outrage media.
- Rhythm: bouts of intensity and recovery; respect seasons of work.
- Decisions: schedule solitude; pick one long-term craft; track energy, not just time.

16) Method: how to use Nietzsche
- Aphorism: no system; you must complete the thought. Contradictions are method.
- Read genealogically: ask function and origin, not truth alone.
- Decisions: test claims on your life. Keep what increases power and honesty. Drop what shrinks you.
- Controversy: system-builder vs destroyer. Default: experimentalist who builds through selective destruction. [robust]

17) Common failure modes
- Moralism in new clothes: swapping gods without creating values.
- Cynicism: truth used to belittle life.
- Hedonism: comfort worship masquerading as liberation.
- Fanatic “yes”: affirmation that denies limits and becomes stupidity.
- Decisions: audit regularly for these; correct with craft, challenge, and earned joys.

18) Quick tests
- Will-to-power check: does this enlarge my range?
- Perspectival check: what other lens flips this?
- Genealogical check: who gains from this value?
- Recurrence check: would I will this again?
- Health check: do I feel more capable after it?
