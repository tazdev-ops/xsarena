# Roadmap (lean, non-bloated)

- UX: ops service connect wrapper (optional)
- Config: directive path helper used consistently across modes
- Rules merge: Python-only helper; treat merged output as a build artifact
- Executor: extract micro-extend and metrics into helpers (no behavior change)
- Optional: command search (xsarena search <term>) and examples (xsarena examples <cmd>)
- Optional: snapshot verify gate (preflight/postflight audit before sharing)

You can extend or adapt these as you evolve the project. If you want a single "North Star" overview that contributors see first, rename ARCHITECTURE.md to docs/OVERVIEW.md and link to the rest.
