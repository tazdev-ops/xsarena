# Internal Operator Notes

## Purpose
This document contains internal operator material and agent-focused workflows that are not required for normal human writer usage of XSArena.

## When These Rules Are Used
- Internal development and testing workflows
- Automated system operations
- Advanced user customization
- Integration with other tools and systems

## Access
These materials are intended for:
- XSArena developers
- System administrators
- Advanced users working on custom integrations
- Internal testing and QA processes

## Relationship to User Workflow
The directives in `directives/_rules` are internal operator material and are not required for normal users who simply want to write books using the standard XSArena workflow.

For normal usage, see the main documentation and `docs/CONCEPT.md`.
