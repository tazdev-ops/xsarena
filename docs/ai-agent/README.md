# AI Agent Guide

This guide provides information for AI agents working with the XSArena project.

## Overview

XSArena is designed to work effectively with AI agents for various tasks including development, content generation, and system management.

## Key Capabilities

### Content Generation
- Book generation with various styles and lengths
- Outline-first content creation
- Style-preserving rewriting
- Continuation from existing content

### System Management
- Job management and monitoring
- Configuration management
- System health checks
- Snapshot creation for context

### Development Support
- Code modification and refactoring
- Testing and verification
- Documentation updates
- Architecture analysis

## Working with XSArena

### Understanding the Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `src/xsarena/` - Main source code
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface
  - `core/` - Core functionality
  - `jobs/` - Job system
  - `backends/` - Backend implementations
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `directives/` - AI instruction files
- `recipes/` - Predefined job configurations

### Common AI Agent Tasks

#### Code Modification
1. Understand the existing architecture
2. Follow established patterns and conventions
3. Test changes when possible
4. Update related components if needed

#### Content Generation
1. Use appropriate run commands for the task
2. Select suitable length and span presets
3. Apply appropriate styles and overlays
4. Monitor job progress and results

#### System Management
1. Check system health regularly
2. Monitor running jobs
3. Create snapshots for context sharing
4. Manage configurations appropriately

## Best Practices

### For Development Tasks
- Always check git status before making changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Test changes thoroughly

### For Content Generation
- Use descriptive subject lines
- Select appropriate length/complexity presets
- Apply suitable styles for the content type
- Monitor output quality and continuity

### For System Management
- Use the health check commands regularly
- Monitor job states and resource usage
- Create snapshots before major changes
- Maintain clean configuration files

## Troubleshooting

When working with AI agents:

1. If commands fail, check the system status first
2. Use health checks to diagnose issues
3. Create snapshots to capture current state
4. Refer to the documentation for guidance
